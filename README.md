# InventoryApp
This project was my final creation in my Android Studio development course, and is definitely the most complicated build. 
It utilizes a Database Contract, a Database Helper, an information Provider, a custom Cursor Adapter for loading
data in the background, and a full suite of separated and organized resource files. 

It is an item inventory app that utilizes an SQLite database to keep track of product data. Users can add products
and specify details to the database, insert dummy data, delete single entries or the whole database (with pop-up
warnings to prevent accidental deletion). There is also an options menu fuction from the 'Edit Product' screen that
sends an intent to call the Supplier Phone number listed for the entry.
